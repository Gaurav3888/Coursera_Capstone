    "2. Post the Data is downloaded it will be conveted in to panda Dataframe using the python libraries\n",
    "3. Once we have the Borough and the verious Neighbourhood with lattitude and Longitude, then 5 different daframe will be created for each borough example one for manhattan, other for bronx etc\n",
    "4. Foursquare API , Explore method will be leveraged to get all the venues for each neighbourhood\n",
    "5. Raw Result from the API will be processed using the python libraries and for each borough a dataframe will be created which will have the following properties\n",
    "   a) Borough\n",
    "   b) VenueName\n",
